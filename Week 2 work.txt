- Planning to create GitHub repo for code and share it with you both so you can check in with what I'm doing

- First thing I did this week was plan out the roadmap I sent you
- Have made progress on implementing that

- Next step of the roadmap was to use Watson's NLU API
- Signed up for Bluemix and started expermenting with that
- Discovered the Python wrapper for this API and explored that
- Got to a stage where I could use this API to analyze tweets I had pulled from the twitter API

- Next step was to use MongoDB to store the tweets and analyzed information
- Downloaded MongoDB and played around with the shell to get a general idea of


- All the coding I did last week was basically API calls in a Python file with no structure
- Worked on adding functions to the code I have written so far
